What the project does
- This is the website I've help developed during my internship in Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Lendu, Melaka. This website
is made to display the Faculty of Accountancy information. It also allows user to search the faculty's published paper and book as well as 
the faculty's staff information. The file isnt complete as my internship period ended before this website is fully finished, thus some files are missing.



Why the project is useful
- The website helps viewer to keep up to date to the faculty's events and see the faculty's information in an easier way with just a simple few clicks.
